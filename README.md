A Python based sudoku solver that uses *backtracking algorithm* to solvr any valid 9x9 sudoku puzzle

---

## Algorithms Used:
- Backtracking
- Recursion
- Constaint Satisfaction

The solver first finds the empty cell in the given unsolved sudoku and tries numbers from 1 to 9 in the founded empty cells, checks sudoku constraints(number not in row, coloumn and the 3x3 box consisting the cell)
Then it uses backtracks when a dead end is reached
